# A SIMPLE SIAMESE FRAMEWORK FOR TIME-DOMAIN SIGNAL REPRESENTATIONSTOWARD CLASS IMBALANCED FAULT DIAGNOSIS
a simple signal Siamese (SigSiam) framework is proposed to yield effective features with unlabeled data via the signal augmentations in the time-domain (TD). The proposed method is evaluated by the balanced and imbalanced motor fault diagnosis with a few labeled data.<br/>
